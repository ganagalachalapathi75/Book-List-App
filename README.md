# Use an App Builder:
Similar in concept to websites builders such as WordPress (a Content Management System allowing you to edit and alter the appearance of your website without any coding), an app builder  is a No-code development platform, a software tool that allows users to create a mobile app without coding and distribute it through different App Stores.
Most app makers provide a visual drag and drop editor in their UI allowing users to preview their app as they build it, in real time.
This is the ideal option to save time and money while achieving a quality app.However, keep in mind that not all projects are suitable for an app builder and that if you have specific and complex needs, you will have to go through a customized solution.
